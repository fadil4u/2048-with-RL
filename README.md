# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Fadil Rahman - CUSAT DCS

### Project Description
My project is the famous 2048 tile game but the twist is that we don't get to play it. A model through reinforcement learning without knowing the rules, learns to play the game and get progressively better. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Problem is the 2048 game is very hard (for me) and i don't wanna play it

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Since i dont wanna play the game i let an agent play the game on its own figure out the rules and get better score each time it plays
